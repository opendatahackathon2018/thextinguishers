Visualization software to analyze current emergency-response hubs (e.g. fire stations, police stations, hospitals) and events related to the hubs (e.g. for fire stations that would be fires; for police stations, that would be car accidents and crime). This repository empowers both national and local governments to determine the weak spots in any emergency response system based on historical data and graph theory.
